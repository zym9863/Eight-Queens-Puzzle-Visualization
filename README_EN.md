# Eight Queens Puzzle Visualization

[中文](README.md) | [English](README_EN.md)

An elegant visualization tool for the Eight Queens Puzzle, demonstrating the solution process through a modern web interface.

## Project Overview

The Eight Queens Puzzle is a classic backtracking algorithm problem that requires placing eight queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This project provides an intuitive visualization interface to demonstrate the solution process, helping users better understand how the backtracking algorithm works.

## Features

- 🎯 Real-time Visualization: Dynamically displays the backtracking algorithm's solution process
- 🎮 Interactive Controls: Supports solution start and reset functionality
- 📊 Status Display: Shows current attempt count and number of solutions found in real-time
- 💫 Elegant Animations: Smooth queen placement animations and state transitions
- 🎨 Modern Interface: Adopts a tech-inspired design style for an excellent visual experience

## Technical Implementation

- Frontend Interface: Built with HTML5 + CSS3 for responsive layout
- Visual Effects: Modern CSS features for gradients, animations, and glassmorphism effects
- Interaction Logic: Native JavaScript implementation of backtracking algorithm and dynamic rendering
- Performance Optimization: Smooth animations through asynchronous operations and delay control

## Usage Instructions

1. Upon opening the page, you'll see an 8×8 chessboard and control panel
2. Click the "Start Solving" button to begin finding solutions to the Eight Queens Puzzle
3. Observe the queen placement process to understand how the backtracking algorithm works
4. The right panel displays the current number of solutions found and attempts in real-time

## Interface Preview

- Tech-inspired UI design
